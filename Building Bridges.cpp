Approach: It is a variation of LIS problem. The following are the steps to solve the problem.

    Sort the north-south pairs on the basis of increasing order of south x-coordinates.
    If two south x-coordinates are same, then sort on the basis of increasing order of north x-coordinates.
    Now find the Longest Increasing Subsequence of the north x-coordinates.
    One thing to note that in the increasing subsequence a value can be greater as well as can be equal to its previous value.
