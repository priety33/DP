/*  Minimum number of increasing subsequences equals to the length of longest decreasing subsequence where
each element from the longest decreasing subsequence represents an increasing subsequence, so it can be found
in N*Log(N) time complexity in the same way as longest increasing subsequence by multiplying all the elements with -1. */
